## Implement toggle

In the test application in the “material-ui” folder, try implementing this toggle for each element in the list. You'll need to use the MUI component and apply this style from the theme, not via 'sx' or 'styled'.

## Retrive element in DOM

In the extract-from-page folder you'll find an index.html file. Open it in a browser and search for the “navigation-link__notification__text” class. You'll notice that one of them contains a number in the text content. 

The idea is to find a solution to retrieve the number of notifications from the correct span with the class.
